# cs-hub
The title of our project is “CS-HUB”. Our project is basically a blog site where all the 
necessary information related to Computer Science can be found and authors can read
specific topics. In this website, the authors can also post their thoughts which are
controlled by the admins.This website aids to learn about the different spheres of
technical and interactive things which are beneficial to others.
CS-HUB is a blogging platform where there are both authors and admins. The authors are
most likely to post and read different articles but they are unable to manage and edit
articles. On the other hand, the admin has the authority to control and edit the articles to
standardize the format of the website.
